Part 1: Data
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a collaborative project between all of the states in the United States (US) and participating US territories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The BRFSS is administered and supported by CDC’s Population Health Surveillance Branch, under the Division of Population Health at the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.

The BRFSS is a project sponsored by the CDC to collect data from the fifty states and territories. The BRFSS collects data from citizens by telephone yearly. The range of questions is fairly diverse and the goal is to collect a minimum of 4,000 interviews per state per year. In the year 2011, about 500,000 were collected. The 2013 dataset contains 330 variables and 491,775 observations. This is a very large data set and the data can be generalized as representative to the general population of the U.S.

BRFSS is an ongoing surveillance system designed to measure behavioral risk factors for the non-institutionalized adult population (18 years of age and older) residing in the US. The BRFSS was initiated in 1984, with 15 states collecting surveillance data on risk behaviors through monthly telephone interviews.

Over time, the number of states participating in the survey increased; by 2001, 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands were participating in the BRFSS. Today, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam collect data annually and American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau collect survey data over a limited point- in-time (usually one to three months). In this document, the term “state” is used to refer to all areas participating in BRFSS, including the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

The BRFSS objective is to collect uniform, state-specific data on preventive health practices and risk behaviors that are linked to chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases that affect the adult population. Factors assessed by the BRFSS in 2013 include tobacco use, HIV/AIDS knowledge and prevention, exercise, immunization, health status, healthy days - health-related quality of life, health care access, inadequate sleep, hypertension awareness, cholesterol awareness, chronic health conditions, alcohol consumption, fruits and vegetables consumption, arthritis burden, and seatbelt use. Since 2011, BRFSS conducts both landline telephone- and cellular telephone-based surveys. In conducting the BRFSS landline telephone survey, interviewers collect data from a randomly selected adult in a household. In conducting the cellular telephone version of the BRFSS questionnaire, interviewers collect data from an adult who participates by using a cellular telephone and resides in a private residence or college housing.

Health characteristics estimated from the BRFSS pertain to the non-institutionalized adult population, aged 18 years or older, who reside in the US. In 2013, additional question sets were included as optional modules to provide a measure for several childhood health and wellness indicators, including asthma prevalence for people aged 17 years or younger.

The dataset is provided in both Stata (.dta) and R Workspace (.Rdata) formats. Categorical values are factors in the R workspace, and value labels are attached in the Stata version (except when a categorical variable contains more than 50 categories.

All missing values are coded NA in the R Workspace. For Stata, missing values are coded missing using the following codes: . (numbers) or empty text field: BLANK; .a: Don’t know/Not sure; .b: Refused; .c: Zero (none); .d: Don’t know/Not Sure Or Refused/Missing

Many variables, such as age, race, education, as well as variables that measure counts of events (drinks, times eating fruit, etc.) have alternate versions in the Calculated Variables section of the dataset. Review this section prior to choosing variables for analysis.

Part 2: Research questions
Research quesion 1:

I will explore from Main Survey - Section 2 - Immunizations and HIV testing:

The variables that will be used are:

tetanus- received a tetanus shot

pneuvac3- received the pneumonia vaccine

hivtst6- person has been tested for AIDS

My research question will be:

What is the distribution of immunizations and HIV testing?

Research quesion 2:

I would like to see if there exists any relation between how many hours one sleeps (SLEPTIM1) and certain health conditions such as Heart Disease(CVDINFR4), and if the patient has ever told their Blood Cholesterol is High (TOLDHI2).

The variables that will be used are:

sleptim1: How Much Time Do You Sleep

cvdinfr4: Ever Diagnosed With Heart Attack

toldhi2: Ever told Blood Cholesterol High

I will:

Run an initial correlation analysis among these variables.

Research quesion 3:

I would like to see if a health condition such as Heart Disease can be predicted using sleep time, Cholesterol, blood pressure etc.

Variables I will be using for that are:

cvdinfr4: Ever Diagnosed With Heart Attack

bloodcho: Ever Had Blood Cholesterol Checked

cholchk: How Long Since Cholesterol Checked

toldhi2: Ever Told Blood Cholesterol High

bphigh4: Ever Told Blood Pressure High

sleptim1: How Much Time Do You Sleep

I will:

Run a basic generalized linear regression analysis among these variables.

Part 3: Exploratory data analysis
Research quesion 1:

plot(brfss2013$tetanus, main= "Tetanus", las = 1, horiz=T)


plot(brfss2013$pneuvac3, main= "Pneumonia shot ever", col= rainbow(2))


plot(brfss2013$hivtst6, main= "Ever tested HIV ", col= c("green", "red"))


Research quesion 2:

# Create a subset of data

subdata <- brfss2013[vars]
# make a backup

# conver factor levels into numeric levels
subdata1$toldhi2 <- ifelse(subdata$toldhi2=="Yes", 1, 0)
subdata1$cvdinfr4 <- ifelse(subdata$cvdinfr4=="Yes", 1, 0)

## Warning: package 'corrplot' was built under R version 3.3.1
M <- cor(subdata1)
corrplot(M, method="ellipse")


From the above we can infer that:

There is almost no correlation between sleeptime and having a heartattack and/or having been told you have high cholesterol.

From the summary we can infer that the model states that sleeping time is insignificant in predicting heart attack conditions while other variables can be significant.
